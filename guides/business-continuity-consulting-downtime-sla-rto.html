                        <p>On September 15, 2025, Starlink went dark—briefly, but globally. Reports spiked to tens of thousands of affected users in the US, and Ukraine's front line felt it immediately because so much of their comms and drone ops ride on Starlink. Service trickled back within roughly 30–60 minutes. Starlink acknowledged a disruption and then removed the notice; no public root cause yet. That's enough of a wake-up call. If your business relies on any single provider for a critical function, this is your rehearsal.</p>
                        
                        <p>If you need help assessing your exposure and building pragmatic redundancy (not buzzwords, actual failover that works), talk to me: <a href="https://dynamicdisorder.co/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dynamicdisorder.co/contact</a>.</p>
                        
                        <p>This isn't an indictment of Starlink. It's a reminder: all providers fail. Cloud. Telco. CDN. Satellite. Your plan has to assume that.</p>

                        <h2>What happened (and why it matters to enterprises, not just armies)</h2>
                        
                        <p><strong>Event:</strong> brief, wide Starlink outage; Ukraine's front line reported impact; service restored within about an hour. <a href="https://reuters.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters</a></p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Context:</strong> Starlink has had previous global incidents (e.g., July 24, 2025, ~2.5h tied to "failure of core internal software services"). Outages happen for many reasons—software, operations, space weather, and plain old "we don't know yet." <a href="https://aerotime.aero" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AeroTime</a></p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Solar storms are real:</strong> May 2024 "severe" geomagnetic storms degraded GPS/HF comms and triggered official impact reviews. Satellite and GNSS-dependent systems see measurable effects. Don't rely on "that never happens." It does. <a href="https://swpc.noaa.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_storm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a></p>
                        
                        <p>The lesson is simple: assume a critical vendor will be intermittently unavailable, sometimes with minimal detail, sometimes at the worst possible moment.</p>

                        <h2>SLAs won't save your uptime (or your P&L)</h2>
                        
                        <p>Read your SLAs and, more importantly, the master agreements. Most big-cloud/service contracts include force-majeure carve-outs. If a storm (solar or otherwise), a power grid issue, or Internet carrier problems sit "outside their reasonable control," you're looking at service credits at best—and those credits won't cover your actual losses. AWS and Microsoft both state force-majeure protections in their standard agreements. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Web Services, Inc.</a></p>
                        
                        <p>Even when credits apply, credits ≠ compensation. Many SLAs make service credits the sole and exclusive remedy—and you'll still have lost revenue, customer trust, and team hours.</p>

                        <p><strong>Uptime Institute (2025):</strong> 54% of surveyed operators said their most recent significant outage exceeded $100,000 in total costs; 20% topped $1 million (up year-on-year). Outages are less frequent/severe, but more expensive. <a href="https://datacenterdynamics.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data Center Dynamics</a></p>
                        
                        <p><strong>ITIC (2024):</strong> 93% of mid-size and large enterprises estimate $300k+ per hour of downtime; a big share reports $1M+. This aligns with what we see in negotiations and post-mortems. <a href="https://lenovo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lenovo</a></p>

                            <li><strong>RPO for data flows:</strong> If uplinks are down, what's the acceptable lag for telemetry, payments, orders, logs? Minutes? Hours? What gets queued locally and replayed cleanly?</li>

                        <p>Big clouds and major providers explicitly exclude events "beyond reasonable control," including storms, power, telco failures. That's standard legal language (force majeure). Read the clause; plan accordingly. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Web Services, Inc.</a></p>
                        
                        <p>Also, credits ≠ cash. You'll still pay your team, refund users, and miss SLAs to your customers.</p>

                        <p>There's a reason governments are pushing for alternatives and sovereign constellations (e.g., EU's IRIS2), and why allies talk openly about over-reliance on any one private network. Even if you're not an army, the pattern holds for enterprises: don't build a business where one company's status page is your single point of failure. <a href="https://reuters.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters</a></p>

                                <h3>Did the 15-Sep outage really hit Ukraine's front line?</h3>
                                <p>Yes. Multiple outlets reported widespread disruption, with Ukrainian commanders saying the entire front line was affected; service returned within an hour. <a href="https://reuters.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters</a>, <a href="https://businessinsider.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Business Insider</a></p>

                                <h3>Was it caused by a solar storm?</h3>
                                <p>Not confirmed publicly. Solar storms do affect satellite/GNSS/HF systems; regulators asked for impact reports after the May 2024 events. Treat space weather as a credible risk, but don't assume it's the cause of this outage until there's a formal RCA. <a href="https://swpc.noaa.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center</a></p>

                                <h3>Do SLAs cover this?</h3>
                                <p>Usually not beyond credits, and force majeure (storms, power, carrier faults) limits liability further.

                                <h3>Is Starlink a bad choice for backup?</h3>
                                <p>No. It can be excellent—especially in rural or disrupted areas. But treat it like any provider: pair it with an independent path, set health checks, and test failover. Also watch policy changes (e.g., standby/"pause" features) if you rely on "backup-only" usage. <a href="https://theverge.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Verge</a></p>
